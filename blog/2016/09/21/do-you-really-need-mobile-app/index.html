                    <div class="post-body p-t-6rem"><p>When you start working on your application with a project manager, he or she will always ask you if you want post-release support. And while at the beginning of the journey it may seem like a long shot, DO NOT brush the suggestion off unthinkingly. You will remember the moment you declined this offer clearly when your app crashes for the first time.</p>
<p>So what is post-release support exactly? Is there a way to get by without it?</p>
<h2>3 ADVANTAGES OF POST-RELEASE SUPPORT</h2>
<p>There are, in fact, dozens of reasons for you to splurge on post-release support. But we will only cover a few for you to get a general idea of why support expenses will earn you more money in the long run.</p>
<h3>Keep Regular Customers</h3>
<p>Customers are everything for any business and having your own app allows you to get direct feedback from them. Pay attention to their wishes and update regularly to let your clients know that you value their input. It will prove that their opinion is important to you and therefore will build brand loyalty and trust which are paramount for profit increase.</p>
<h3>Stay on Top of the Competition via Design Updates</h3>
<p>Do you still remember the times when cellphones had buttons instead of touch screens? While fixing problems and updating application&#8217;s functionality is a common practice, complete redesign or simple UX design update are usually considered a waste of time and money. But you shouldn&#8217;t forget, that mobile app design is constantly evolving. And if you want to stay ahead of the competition, you ought to update the look of your application, so that it doesn&#8217;t seem outdated and unappealing.</p>

<h3>Build Brand Loyalty Through Security Maintenance</h3>
<p>Teens nowadays are so bored at school that they hack sites and mobile applications for fun. To keep scammers at bay and secure your clients&#8217; personal information, your application post-release support plan should definitely include a regular security check with bug fixes and security measures reinforcement when necessary.</p>
<h2>WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO CONSIDER POST-RELEASE SUPPORT?</h2>
<p>Business is often compared to a game of chess and that&#8217;s because to be successful in either field you need to think 5 or 10 steps ahead. Creating a mobile application does not end when it is officially accepted by Google Play Store or Apple App Store. If you want to generate a generous income you need to consider your clients’ wishes and feedback once they start installing the application.</p>
<p>Like in a game of speed chess you won&#8217;t have time to explain what you want to be done and which features your clients need to a new team of developers. That is why you should think about hiring the same team who designed and developed the app in the first place to manage the post-release support.</p>
<p>This way any updates and bug fixes will be quick and easy because people behind the support efforts already know what you need and how to tweak the application without disrupting its work. It is always advisable to work with the same project manager and developer team from the start because they learn your business goals and values and can give your customers what they need.</p>
<h2>POST-RELEASE SUPPORT VS. ONGOING MOBILE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>Now, when you know why supporting your app after the launch is important, let&#8217;s get our terms straight.</p>
<p>Post-release support service commonly includes only simple bug fixes after the app is done and deployed. This cooperation mode suggests that developers will regularly check if all the features of your application work properly. The team will also look for any errors and fix any bugs detected. Another important mission of the team is identifying the point at which scaling should be considered. This will prevent your app from crashing when the number of users exceeds its capability.</p>
<p>Ongoing Mobile Development takes it a step further. This cooperation mode allows you to change the app any way you want. Developers can add new features or get rid of redundant ones. They can even implement whole new directions inside your app. The team will do all the scaling work and redesign the app when the time comes. Full updates will also be possible at any given time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to you to choose the cooperation mode depending on your budget and needs. But remember that it&#8217;s always easier to work on post-release support with the team that developed your application rather than looking for new developers.</p>
<h2>AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY OR A NECESSITY?</h2>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to buy cheaply and pay dearly, do not scrimp on post-release support. Remember, that every minute of application downtime will cost you clients. And that means that you&#8217;re going to lose the trust of your regular customers and eventually see the decrease in revenue. Being a wise businessman means thinking many steps ahead and post-release support can become your ultimate key to successful.</p>
